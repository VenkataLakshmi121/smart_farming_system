<ul>
<li>The disease symptoms are preceded by the appearance of prominent spots of loose green colour due
to rotting which extend and cover the entire leaf. The infected leaves get detached from the plant. More
or less round sclerotic, brown spots are formed on and around the infected leaf. As a result, the
infected plant becomes weak and unproductive.</li>
<li>Control: The disease can be controlled by soil application of Brassicol (20%) @ 30kg/hectare</li>
